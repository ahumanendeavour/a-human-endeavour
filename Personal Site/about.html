       <h3>30s - he/him - actor and theatre-maker - scottish</h3>
       <p>If you know me at all, then those few details might well be enough to recognise me. If so, Hi!</p>
       <p>I've been a working actor, at lesser or greater levels of "success", for around ten years now. I've been to drama school, toured internationally, recorded audiobooks, narrated documentaries, taught acting to performers of all ages, and been on tv with some pretty big names.</p>
       <p>But I'm still a long way off using it to pay my bills.</p>
       <p>I still have a non-acting day job where the inconsistent frequency of shifts leaves me nervous, I still have to cram in audition prep at the last minute, and my work-life balance is all out of whack.</p>
       <p>Hopefully this blog will be an interesting insight into what I get up to, and maybe even a new fulfilling creative outlet for me.</p>
