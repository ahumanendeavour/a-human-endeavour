      <h2>This site is...</h2>
      <p>This site is a hodgepodge of ideas, inspirations, and chunks of code butchered from other projects, including some of my own. I've made every effort to catalogue what I've used here. No doubt this list will expand as the site does.</p>
       <br>
      <h3>Technical Resources</h3>
      <p>The JS coding that enables the post lists, the picture galleries, and the header/footer injection, as well as the CSS code that makes them all look pretty, came from...</p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="https://zonelets.net/">Zonelets</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/cdvr/Zonelots">ZoneLots</a></li> 
       <li><a href="https://splendide-mendax.com/">The Bumblebee Framework</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of these projects have been massively helpful in implementing incredibly useful features, that would have been far beyond me at my current level of understanding. </p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a> For the few bits of pixel-art. 
      <li>Pictures taken by me unless credited otherwise.
      <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>for hosting.
      <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> Specifically the October 2024 build because I updated my software half way through making this and it decided my OS was too old and wouldn't let me use it at all anymore.
      <li><a href="https://koderapp.com/">Koder</a> for IPhone for whipping up entries in html on the go.
      </ul>
      
      
      <br>
      
      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>These blogs have been, and still are, huge inspirations to me, both in terms of design and writing. Go give them some love.</p>
        
       
      <p><h4><a href="https://jamesg.blog/"> James' Coffee Blog</a></h4> <p>- Brilliant writer, lovely person, and fellow Scot. His nature writing makes me feel like IÃ­m at home wherever I am, and his technical and design principles were game changers for me. </p>
      
      <p><h4><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">Manuel Moreale and his P&B series</a></h4> <p>- A beautifully chill and honest blog in it's own right. But the resource he provides for the IndieWeb community with his People and Blogs series is invaluable.</p>
      
      <p><h4><a href="https://notes.jeddacp.com/">Notes by JCProbably</a></h4> <p>- Blogging is not always about Traffic is one of the posts that made me jump back down the personal website rabbit hole. Her weekly roundups deliver some amazing blogs to read. I binged about five of them the other night and read every blog she linked to. </p>
      
      <p><h4><a href="https://32bit.cafe/">32bitcafe</a></h4> <p>- The indieweb would be a much less accessible place without this lot.</p>
